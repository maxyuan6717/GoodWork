# Good Work Application

Why waste energy alone in the gym when you could be using that energy to both positively influence those around you and improve your health.

Good Work is an android application that crawls volunteermatch.org for volunteer opportunities around you and uses machine learning text classification to determine if those opportunities require physical activity. The data that is crawled from the website is then imported into Firebase's realtime database. The android app can then access this data and display it to the user.
